# JS-Calculator
A simple javascript calculator that can be used in all situations.

## Why is this a good programme?

A javascript-based calculator that is fully capable of the four basic operations. It can accept data that can be written out as negative, positive or even a fractional number. The text part is completely disabled so you can only enter data with the keystrokes provided by html.

**The program can be integrated into your own part by specifying the appropriate builders.**
>The program may contain bugs, these will be fixed later.
